# Run Tests Command

You are tasked with intelligently executing and analyzing Apache Struts tests using the specialized test-runner agent and other supporting agents as needed.

## Initial Setup

When this command is invoked, respond with:
```
I'm ready to execute and analyze tests for your Apache Struts project. I can run various types of tests and provide detailed analysis of results.

What type of test execution would you like?
1. Full test suite (all modules with coverage analysis)
2. Quick smoke tests (essential functionality only)
3. Module-specific tests (choose specific Maven modules)
4. Pattern-based tests (run tests matching specific patterns)
5. Security-focused tests (security and vulnerability tests)
6. Performance validation tests (performance regression detection)
7. Pre-commit validation (tests for recent changes)
```

Then wait for the user's selection or specific test requirements.

## Test Execution Process

### 1. Test Strategy Determination

Based on user selection, determine test execution strategy:

**Full Test Suite:**
- Execute complete test suite across all modules
- Generate comprehensive coverage reports
- Analyze performance trends
- Validate security test coverage

**Quick Smoke Tests:**
- Focus on critical functionality tests
- Fast execution for rapid feedback
- Essential security tests included
- Core module validation

**Module-Specific Tests:**
- Ask user to specify modules (core, plugins/*, apps/*)
- Execute tests for selected modules only
- Module-specific coverage analysis
- Inter-module dependency validation

**Pattern-Based Tests:**
- Ask user for test patterns or component types
- Execute tests matching patterns
- Focused analysis on specific functionality
- Related component testing

**Security-Focused Tests:**
- All security-related test execution
- OGNL injection prevention tests
- Parameter filtering validation
- File upload security tests

**Performance Validation:**
- Performance regression detection
- Load testing execution
- Memory usage analysis
- Response time validation

**Pre-commit Validation:**
- Tests affected by recent changes
- Critical path validation
- Security regression prevention
- Quick feedback cycle

### 2. Test Execution Strategy

**Launch the test-runner agent with appropriate parameters:**

For full test suite:
```
Use the test-runner agent to execute the complete Apache Struts test suite:
- Run all tests across core, plugins, and apps modules
- Generate comprehensive coverage reports using JaCoCo
- Analyze test execution performance and identify slow tests
- Validate security test coverage for critical components
- Provide detailed failure analysis with remediation guidance
- Include performance regression detection

Execute with: mvn clean test jacoco:report -DskipAssembly
```

For quick smoke tests:
```
Use the test-runner agent to execute essential smoke tests:
- Focus on critical functionality in core module
- Run basic security tests (OGNL, parameter handling)
- Execute key integration tests
- Validate basic plugin functionality
- Provide rapid feedback on test status

Execute with: mvn test -Dtest=*Smoke*Test,*Security*Test -DskipAssembly
```

For module-specific testing:
```
Use the test-runner agent to execute tests for [specified modules]:
- Run comprehensive tests for selected modules
- Analyze module-specific test coverage
- Validate inter-module dependencies
- Check for module-specific performance issues
- Provide module-focused remediation guidance

Execute with: mvn test -pl [modules] -DskipAssembly
```

### 3. Supporting Analysis

Based on test type, may launch additional agents:

**Security Test Validation (for security-focused testing):**
```
Use the security-analyzer agent to validate security test coverage:
- Analyze security test completeness
- Identify missing security test scenarios
- Validate security test effectiveness
- Check for security regression test gaps
```

**Code Quality Impact (for comprehensive testing):**
```
Use the code-quality-checker agent to assess test quality:
- Analyze test code quality and patterns
- Validate test coverage adequacy
- Review test documentation and maintainability
- Identify test code improvements needed
```

**Configuration Testing (when relevant):**
```
Use the config-validator agent to validate configuration-related tests:
- Check configuration parsing test coverage
- Validate configuration validation tests
- Ensure configuration security tests are comprehensive
```

### 4. Results Analysis and Reporting

After test execution completes:

1. **Compile test results** from all modules and test types
2. **Analyze failure patterns** and categorize by severity
3. **Generate coverage reports** and identify gaps
4. **Assess performance trends** and regression indicators
5. **Provide specific remediation guidance** for failures
6. **Generate comprehensive test report**

/run_tests security

# Module-specific testing
/run_tests module core
```

### 2. CI/CD Integration
- Automated test execution in build pipeline
- Test result analysis and reporting

### 3. Release Validation
- Comprehensive test suite execution
- Performance benchmark validation
- Security test compliance verification
- Integration test coverage validation

## Emergency Test Response

If critical test failures are detected:

1. **Immediate Assessment**: Determine if failures indicate functional regression
2. **Impact Analysis**: Assess business impact of failing functionality
3. **Root Cause Analysis**: Investigate underlying cause of failures
4. **Fix Prioritization**: Prioritize fixes based on severity and impact
5. **Validation**: Ensure fixes don't introduce new regressions
6. **Process Improvement**: Analyze how to prevent similar failures

Remember: Testing is crucial for maintaining Struts application quality and security. Always prioritize security tests and ensure comprehensive coverage of critical functionality.
