# Validate Implementation Plan

You are tasked with systematically verifying the successful implementation of a software development plan for Apache Struts development. This command helps ensure that implementation plans were executed correctly, success criteria were met, and all expected changes were implemented according to specifications.

## Initial Setup

When this command is invoked, respond with:
```
I'm ready to validate your implementation plan. Please provide:
1. The path to the implementation plan (e.g., thoughts/shared/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-WW-XXXX-feature.md)
2. Or describe what was implemented so I can locate the relevant plan

I'll systematically verify that the implementation matches the plan's requirements and success criteria.
```

Then wait for the user's validation request.

## Validation Methodology

### Phase 1: Context Discovery & Setup

1. **Locate Implementation Plan:**
   - If user provides a specific plan path, read it fully using Read tool
   - If no path provided, use **thoughts-locator** agent to find relevant implementation plans
   - Search for recent plans in `thoughts/shared/plans/` matching the user's description
   - Look for WW-XXXX ticket patterns if mentioned

2. **Plan Analysis:**
   - Use **thoughts-analyzer** agent to extract key details from the implementation plan:
     - Expected file changes and new components
     - Success criteria (automated and manual)
     - Security requirements and CVE mitigations
     - Performance expectations
     - Testing requirements

3. **Setup Validation Tracking:**
   - Use TodoWrite to create validation checklist based on plan requirements
   - Mark validation phases as pending initially

### Phase 2: Parallel Implementation Verification

**Launch multiple Task agents concurrently to verify different aspects:**

4. **Codebase Structure Verification:**
   - Use **codebase-locator** agent to find all files mentioned in the implementation plan
   - Verify that expected new files were created
   - Check that expected modifications were made to existing files
   - Confirm Maven module structure changes (`/core/`, `/plugins/`, `/apps/`, `/jakarta/`)

5. **Implementation Quality Analysis:**
   - Use **codebase-analyzer** agent to analyze the implemented components:
     - Maven dependencies and build configuration changes
     - Security implementations (OGNL patterns, CVE mitigations)
     - Interceptor stack integration and ordering
     - Plugin architecture compliance
   - Verify adherence to Apache Struts architectural patterns

6. **Pattern Compliance Verification:**
   - Use **codebase-pattern-finder** agent to check if implementations follow established patterns:
     - Action class patterns (ActionSupport, ModelDriven)
     - Interceptor implementations and configurations
     - Result type usage and custom implementations
     - Validation approach consistency (XML vs annotations)
     - Security patterns for OGNL injection prevention

### Phase 3: Automated Verification

7. **Build and Test Verification:**
   - Execute `mvn clean install` to verify successful build
   - Run `mvn test -DskipAssembly` to execute test suite
   - Check that all tests pass as expected in the plan
   - Verify no new build errors or warnings introduced

8. **Security Validation:**
   - Search for OGNL expressions that might introduce vulnerabilities
   - Verify parameter filtering and validation implementations
   - Check for proper security interceptor configurations
   - Validate CVE mitigation patterns (CVE-2017-5638, CVE-2018-11776, etc.)

9. **Performance Assessment:**
   - Analyze impact on request processing pipeline
   - Check interceptor stack execution overhead
   - Verify memory usage patterns align with expectations
   - Confirm no performance regressions introduced

### Phase 4: Historical Verification

10. **Git History Analysis:**
    - Run `git log --oneline --since="[plan-date]"` to see commits since plan creation
    - Verify expected commits were made
    - Check commit messages align with plan requirements
    - Confirm no unexpected changes were introduced

11. **Documentation and Configuration:**
    - Verify configuration files were updated as planned (struts.xml, struts-plugin.xml)
    - Check that JavaDoc documentation was added as specified
    - Confirm example applications were updated if required
    - Validate that migration documentation was created if needed

### Phase 5: Comprehensive Assessment

12. **Success Criteria Evaluation:**
    - Check each automated criterion from the plan (build passes, tests pass, etc.)
    - Evaluate manual criteria based on available evidence
    - Assess security requirements compliance
    - Verify performance benchmarks if specified

13. **Gap Analysis:**
    - Identify any plan requirements that weren't implemented
    - Document deviations from the original plan
    - Note any additional work done beyond the plan scope
    - Highlight potential issues or concerns

### Phase 6: Validation Report Generation

14. **Generate Validation Report:**
    - Create comprehensive report at `thoughts/shared/validation/YYYY-MM-DD-WW-XXXX-validation.md`
    - Use consistent naming with date and ticket number
    - Include YAML frontmatter with validation metadata
